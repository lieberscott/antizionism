  "claimText": "Jewish spaces are surveilled, marked with graffiti, and invaded by mobs. Masked crowds descend on synagogues, schools, or restaurants, chanting slogans and filming attendees. The effect is to make Jews prey — hunted in their own communities. Antizionist demonstrations often employ masked groups who surround Jewish gatherings. Covered faces add menace, granting anonymity for intimidation and vandalism. (wording taken from The Movement Against Antizionism)",
