    "text": "Antizionists commit battery and property destruction against Jews outside Wilshire Blvd Temple in LA. They are protesting a keynote speech by a researcher at an Israeli defense firm, Elbit Systems. According to event materials, speakers focused on 'AI-driven safety tools' that communities could use 'to strengthen local security without relying solely on government agencies,' and discussed safety challenges 'amid pro-Palestinian protests.' The program featured Israeli defense sector speakers and a Korean missionary. The antizionist flier says: 'We do not believe the lie that Elbit Systems and the genocidal state of Israel which has attacked 5 of its neighbors in the last 2 years and uses their technology to target humanitarian relief sites, refugee camps and hospitals will be able to make LA safer.'",
